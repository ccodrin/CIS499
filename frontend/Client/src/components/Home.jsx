          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <br></br><br></br>
          <p>ParkSmart is a proof of concept project directed towards benefitting the Faculty,
             and Student Body as well as the Lander University Police Department. Much like any other high traffic area,
              the parking at Lander is scarce, creating frustration among Students and Faculty when they own a pass 
              and drive all the way to the parking lot just to find out that there is no spot available. 
              ParkSmart will assist in making the pass owners experience better by informing them if 
              there are any parking spots available through the use of a web application. 
              On the other side, the use of license plate reading software which utilizes a 
              machine learning model will allow us to provide a added layer of security for LUPD. Our system
               will track all the traffic coming in and out of the parking lot using hardware components such 
               as microprocessing boards, cameras and sensors. The system will also compare the carsâ€™ information 
               against the valid passes inside the Microsoft SQL server database to flag the unauthorized users 
               and display it to the LUPD portal.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
               <p>On another note, none of this would be possible without the help of a license plate reader API. Thanks to the generosity
                 of <a href = "https://platerecognizer.com/">PlateRecognizer.com</a>, we have successfully managed to scan and parse the data of a license
                 plate, send it to the database, and show this information on the frontend of our website.
